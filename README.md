# Quantum-Machine-Learning
A presentation on the applications of quantum computing to neural networks.


First, I provide background on machine learning and the 3 steps of the quantum computing process, speculating how quantum computing might improve machine learning algorithms and data interpretation.

Then, I discuss the limitations inherent in the quantum computing process that make it possibly entirely unsuitable for machine learning applications.

Lastly, I define a possible solution to combating these inefficiencies and making quantum computing incredibly beneficial to machine learning systems: quantum sensing.
